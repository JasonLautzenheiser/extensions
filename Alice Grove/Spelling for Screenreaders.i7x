"Gives players the option to have unusual words spelled letter-by-letter so they'll be more screenreader-friendly."


Section - Spelling Mode

spelling-mode is a truth state that varies. spelling-mode is initially false.

A thing can be spellable. A thing is usually not spellable.

A thing can be either unspelled in spelling mode or spelled in spelling mode. A spellable thing is usually spelled in spelling mode.

After printing the name of an spellable thing (called the current item) when spelling-mode is true and the current item is spelled in spelling mode (this is the actually spell the spellable thing rule):
	let current name be the printed name of the current item;
	let total characters be the number of characters in current name;
	say " (spelled [run paragraph on]" (A);
	repeat with N running from 1 to total characters :
		say "[character number N in current name]" (B);

---- DOCUMENTATION ---- 

This extension is intended for stories with many unusually-spelled things. Stories with only a few unusually-spelled things may want to handle them with footnotes that allow the player to request the spelling of particular words (see this thread: http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=19617&start=30#p109201).

To make a thing spellable, we declare it to be "spellable." If we want things to be spelled out when they appear in descriptions, we'll need to put them in square brackets so that Inform knows when it is printing the name of a particular thing.

(Note: If we happen to be using the Common Commands Sidebar extension in the same project, we can include the option "including extension commands" in our "prepare the commands sidebar" line to automatically add the spelling commands to the sidebar.)

Example: * Spelling Lab - A tiny game featuring some spellable items. Please type "Y" at the opening prompt in order for the test script to work as it should.

	*: "Spelling Lab"
	
	Include Spelling for Screenreaders by Alice Grove.

	Spelling Lab is a room.

	A gurphlub is here. "A [gurphlub] lies on the floor." The gurphlub is spellable.

	A detember is here. "A [detember] is stowed away in the corner." The detember is spellable.

	A sneaker is here.

	Test me with "stop spelling gurphlub / look / spell all / look / spelling / look".
